Considering a single image as a vertex, autoencoder and SimCLR are employed to extract discriminative node features. Then two similarity-based strategies for adjacency matrix construction are designed. Initial residual connection and identity mapping methods are injected into SelfSAGCN, a model for weakly-supervised node classification, to ease the over-smoothing problem and improve its performance. The framework achieves better performance on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets, compared with existing weakly-supervised image classification models based on GCNs.

Proposed a microscopic image dataset consisting of 7500 microscopic images in the size of 256√ó256 with punctate highlights and 7500 corresponding images without highlights. We combine the traditional method of highlight removal with the deep learning model pix2pixHD. The traditional method is employed to generate a binary mask indicating the approximate highlight area as the priori information. Then the mask is concatenated with the 3-channel highlighted microscopic image as the input of the generator. Our model is trained by calculating a weighted GAN loss to achieve a better performance of highlight removal. Specifically, we simply increase the weight of loss of highlighted pixels according to the binary mask.
